block box behaivier : 
1_ the box will break onto a new line
2_th width and heghti are respected
3_the margin and border and padding properties could cause other element push away from the box

inline box behavier : 
1_the box will not break onto a new line
2_width and height will not applu 
4_the margin and padding and border are applying and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.

these two behavior is outer dispaly box but when you use flex and grid youur element still
use the block value as outer display but inner display changed to flex and their children
set as flex items

box model : 
applies to the block level element 
Parts of a box
Making up a block box in CSS we have the:

Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.
Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.
for instance : 

.box {
  width: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}

in this case box model includde width and height as content box and margin is margin box and padding is padding box and border-width is border box

when box-sizing: border-box you want to use alternatice space for element when you use it content space is decrease with the padding and border for example in the above example 

box model in inline element a bit different, width and heigth are not apply and the margin can not push away other element in page 

display: inline-block have a middle relation betwenn inline and block element it respect the width and height and do not break a new line and the margin and padding push away other element
