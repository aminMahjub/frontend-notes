Cacade : cascade means the order of the css rules matter, when two rules applied to same element
and they have equal specifity, the rules that is last is applied to element 

Specifity : is the algorythm browses uses for decide which property value should applied to element 
The universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~, ' '), and specificity adjustment selector (:where()) have no effect on specificity.


    Indentifiers: Score one in this column for each ID selector contained inside the overall selector.
    Classes: Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.
    Elements: Score one in this column for each element selector or pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.

this is very good resource for speicifity : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#specificity_2

Inheritance : 
some css property values set on parent element are inheritance by their child 
element for instance color and font-family and some of property like border and width don't
inherited 	

inherit value: set the inherited concept manual

initial value: set the defualt value from css definition not user agent style from browsers for exmaple for div display defualt value is block but when you set initial value, it set by inline value of display because default value of 
display is inline

unset value: if the selected element is the inherited it act like initial means set the 
default value for element but when the element is not inherited it like inherit means the
value will be inherited 

all property : is the property for inheritance cpncpet and it reset all the propery of 
the element rely on the value of this property
these three concept control wich rule applied to element 

revert: set the property to the default value by user agent style
