The aspect-ratio CSS property sets a preferred aspect ratio for the box,
 which will be used in the calculation of auto sizes and some other layout functions.

The box's preferred aspect ratio is the specified ratio of width / height.
 If height and the preceding slash character are omitted, 
height defaults to 1. Size calculations involving preferred aspect ratio work with the dimensions of the box specified by box-sizing.

If both auto and a <ratio> are specified together, the preferred aspect ratio is the specified ratio of width divided by height, 
unless it is a replaced element with an intrinsic aspect ratio, in which case that aspect ratio is used instead.
