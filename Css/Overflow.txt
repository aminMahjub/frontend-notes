Overflow : what happaend when there is too much content to fit in a container and why 
not css hide overflowing content? becuase it could be a data loss in the page and may 
the programmer doesn't find the problem of content beacuase content is hiding behind 
the container, So it is good for debugging 

for crop the content when it is bigger than container you should give the container 
ovreflow: hidden also you like to add scroll you can added in this way => overflwo 
scroll and if the content is not bigger than container the scrollbar are even show in 
the page you can give the overflow-y or overflow-x for x and y axis

overflow shourthand: overflow: overflow-x a, overflow-y

If you only want scrollbars to appear when there is more content than can fit in the box, use overflow: auto. This allows the browser to determine if it should display scrollbars.
