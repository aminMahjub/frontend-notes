-everything in css generate the css box If you place an image inside a box that is smaller or larger than the intrinsic dimensions of the image file in either direction, it will either appear smaller than the box, or overflow the box

-if you use the max-width of 100% your image will not be larger than its contaier

- you can use object-fit to cover or contain the image of the box 

-In some browsers, form elements do not inherit font styling by default. Therefore, if you want to be sure that your form fields use the font defined on the body,
 or on a parent element, you should add this rule to your CSS :

button,
input,
select,
textarea {
  font-family : inherit;
  font-size : 100%;
}

as reset
