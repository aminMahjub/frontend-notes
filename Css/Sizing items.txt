if you use the image without any width and height, it has a inherited size in its information
file 

When you use margin and padding set in percentages, the value is calculated from the inline size of the containing block 
â€” therefore the width when working in a horizontal language. In our example, all of the margins and padding are 10% of the width.
 This means you can have equal-sized margins and padding all around the box.
 This is a fact worth remembering if you do use percentages in this way.
