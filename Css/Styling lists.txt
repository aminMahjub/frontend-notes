you can use value attr in li element to set the value of the list items


@counter-style at-rules => 
it used to define the custom counting style for list items in ul or ol.

for example :
@counter-style thumbs {
  system: cyclic;
  symbols: "\1F44D";
  suffix: " ";
}

ul {
  list-style: thumbs;
}

system => you can define the system of the counting style : 
cyclic: nce the end of the list of symbols is reached, it will loop back to the beginning and start over,At least one symbol must be specified in the symbols descriptor or the counter style is not valid
fixed: Once the system has looped through all the specified symbols, it will fall back, At least one symbol must be specified in the symbols descriptor or the counter style is not valid
symbolatic: defines the symbol 
numeric
alephatic 

symbols => use the symbols of the counter
seffix and prefix use for suffix and prefix of list item
