We have two kind of sass syntax : 
1_SCSS format: it support all sass features and css sassy css
2_original sass format: it support all features of sass but when you write code you do
not write curly braces and semicalons

when you use css variables browser complie it to variable and then use it but when you
use sass variables browser just use the value of the variable and it has 100% compatibility


you can use map in sass like object in js for example you define a bunch of variables for 
font-weight: 

$font-weight (
	"regular": 400,
	"bold": 700
)


body {
	font-weight: map-get($font-weight, bold)
}


& equals to parent in sass
